## Introduction

An important service provided by the library is instruction services. These services include librarians working with faculty to develop library instruction classes. In these classes, students learn to navigate and evaluate library resources necessary to complete their course assignments. These assignments range from finding books, articles, newspaper articles, primary resources, and more.

Involved in the process of developing instruction are several steps:

* informing faculty of services available
* allowing faculty to request customized instruction
* developing detailed lesson plans for the instruction
* collecting data on instructional activities
* performing analysis on data

#### The Challenge

The aim of the lesson plan website is to be a one-stop-shop for developing classes and lesson plans, saving the plans in a database, and providing a place of data analysis. This poses several challenges - to create an interactive website that can retrieve and persist data. The main challenge is having the website do many things in one place, but keeping it all tidy and logically organized. The pieces of the website - lesson plans, class builder, data analysis - will be dependent on common data sources. Having everything work together smoothly and present a coherent and intuitive user experience is the main challenge of the website.

#### The Solution



#### Requirements

* User accounts for librarians and faculty with login capabilities
* Librarians can administer lesson plans and classes
* Site administrator oversees lesson plans, classes, and user accounts
* Home page with contextual navigational links to build a class, lesson plans, data dashboard, site administration, and an about page.
